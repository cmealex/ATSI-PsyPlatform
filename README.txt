PLACEHOLDER IMAGES

This directory should contain the following placeholder images:

1. placeholder.jpg - Default therapist profile image (200x200px recommended)
2. team-placeholder.jpg - Team member profile image (150x150px recommended)

In a production environment, these should be replaced with actual images. The application is configured to look for these specific filenames.

For testing purposes, you can use any image and rename it to match these filenames.

Note: When implementing the final version, a proper image uploading and management system should be developed to allow therapists to upload their own profile pictures.
